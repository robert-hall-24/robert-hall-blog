            1: How I solve my problems hsa been newest thing especially learning
            code. I really need to break things down and not over complicated
            it.
            <br />
            2: I really enjoy creating things out of code has been the cool
            discovery seeing the end result of a code challenge is a great
            feeling.
            <br />
            3: Coding can be really and I can panic about it! So I think I need
            to know that is gonna be journey.

            When coding is really important especially when pair programming. To

            It was really good to reflection on learning and create a blog or
            talk about the process and feeling of Foundations. The biggest
            surprise for me was the amount of information I remember at the end
            of the sprint when writing the blogs.

            I think the reflection of feelings have been the hardest to share.
            But also it is good to step out of comfort zone.

            No learning core learning is super important. Cause we creating code
            for people to use most of the time and we will be working with
            people.

            <br />
            Having a little dip in tech myself these skills are sometimes even
            more important to learn than coding itself. Knowing your style and
            strengths is very important. It gives in that edge in the workplace.
