    <h3>What is your long-term goal or career pathway?</h3>
    <p>
      My long career path is to create software that helps people! I have had a
      lot of fun creating the html and css websites. I wanna build on that!
    </p>
    <h3>
      A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to learning
    </h3>
    <p>
      My strength is the passion to learn new things! Think visually and outside
      the box. I love deep driving into things. My limitation is reading and
      writing.
    </p>
    <h3>
      What skills (non-technical core/human skills) would you like to see
      developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?
    </h3>
    <p>
      Discipline and time management are two things I struggle with, so I want
      to improve that.
    </p>
    <h3>
      A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme. This
      should include:
    </h3>
    <p>
      My commitment to my workload is around 15 - 20 hours a week for
      foundations. I will ensure I take breaks between long coding sessions and
      treat everyone respectfully. Also, make time to do things that keep me
      happy, like walking the dog, gaming, and hanging with friends.
    </p>
    <h3>A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way</h3>
    <p>
      If I get stuck, I will contact the helpdesk or contact a teacher directly
      on Discord if I am stuck for longer than 15 minutes.
    </p>
    <h3>A description of what you expect from the Facilitation team</h3>
    <p>
      Sending out comms on Discord on what needs to be done at the start of the
      sprint and end of the spirit. Also, make sure we connect over a video call
      as well.
    </p>
    <h3>
      Any scheduling information, such as block-out times when you are committed
      to other things. For example, you might have whƒÅnau commitments like
      school drop-offs. It's important to plan these in.
    </h3>
    <p>
      My block at the moment is working full time. But I have flexible
      arrangements around that.
