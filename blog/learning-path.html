    <h3>What is your long-term goal or career pathway?</h3>
    <p>
      My long career path is to create software that helps people! I have had a
      lot of fun creating the html and css websites. I wanna build on that!
    </p>
    <h3>
      A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to learning
    </h3>
    <p>
      My strength is the passion to learn new things! Think visually and outside
      the box. I love deep driving into things. My limitation is reading and
      writing.
    </p>
    <h3>
      What skills (non-technical core/human skills) would you like to see
      developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?
    </h3>
    <p>
      Discipline and time management are two things I struggle with, so I want
      to improve that.
    </p>
    <h3>
      A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme. This
      should include:
    </h3>
    <p>
      My commitment to my workload is around 15 - 20 hours a week for
      foundations. I will ensure I take breaks between long coding sessions and
      treat everyone respectfully. Also, make time to do things that keep me
      happy, like walking the dog, gaming, and hanging with friends.
    </p>
    <h3>A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way</h3>
    <p>
      If I get stuck, I will contact the helpdesk or contact a teacher directly
      on Discord if I am stuck for longer than 15 minutes.
    </p>
    <h3>A description of what you expect from the Facilitation team</h3>
    <p>
      Sending out comms on Discord on what needs to be done at the start of the
      sprint and end of the spirit. Also, make sure we connect over a video call
      as well.
    </p>
    <h3>
      Any scheduling information, such as block-out times when you are committed
      to other things. For example, you might have whƒÅnau commitments like
      school drop-offs. It's important to plan these in.
    </h3>
    <p>
      My block at the moment is working full time. But I have flexible
      arrangements around that.
    </p>
    <h3>Updated Learning Plan</h3>
    <p>
      Reflecting on the end of foundations. My goals still quite similar have a
      job as developer that creates a positive impact to people.
      <br />
      <br />
      My strengths and limitations have defiantly stretched I am way better at
      problem-solving that I thought I would be. My limitations are very clear
      that I need to make sure I step away from my code when I am struggling.
      <br />
      <br />
      My biggest no-technical challenge at foundations has been my anxiety. I do
      tend to slip into panic mode when I look at code and have no idea where to
      start.
      <br />
      <br />
      Some core skills I would love master more is being better a breaking down
      a problem and working on small chucks and Not focus too much on the whole
      piece of the problem. Also be better at asking for help when needed. For
      boot camp I want to focus on consistency! time management and better at
      debugging code instead deleting it all.
      <br />
      <br />
      For the Bootcamp team I would like to see more visually walkthrough. Me
      being dyslexic reading a big wall of text can be hard.
      <br />
      <br />
      For boot camp I want to focus on consistency! time management and better
      at not judging myself.
