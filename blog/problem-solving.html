            Javascript is challenging to learn at the start. One of the things
            we easily miss at the beginning is typos and mistakes with naming
            objects or arrays and calling them correctly since we are absorbing
            a huge amount of information.
            <br />
            <br />
            The one small problem I constantly encounter is forgetting letters
            from the objects or arrays I create. The biggest culprit is the
            letter S! The number of terms I have created, objects or arrays,
            called letters or words, and typing out words or letters when
            calling them was way too common.
            <br />
            <br />
            This was very frustrating, especially when you redo your code to be
            more complex, and the fix is simple.
            <br />
            <br />
            The main lesson from this is to check that the objects, arrays, and
            functions you call are spelled correctly before diving into your
            code and redoing it.

            The time I elegantly solved a problem was recently with this blog.
            What I wanted to do was streamline my blog creation process so that
            when blogs are created in the future, the process is easy for adding
            content without starting a new one.
            <br />
            <br />
            The great thing about CSS is that it is reusable, so you can access
            code across different web pages, as you can see on my blog. Which I
            am doing already to save time and for my website to have the same
            theme.
            <br />
            <br />
            I wanted to take it further and start templating my blog pages. So
            when I create new blogs, I have the bones of the page already up; I
            just need to fill it with content.
            <br />
            <br />
            Doing this makes me understand why it is essential to code for
            scale, not just for the present.

            The Javascript kata was a great exercise using different methods to find solutions to make the code work. I used Google and an online code editor to copy the existing code and see what console.log() is outputting
            <br />
            <br />
            Pseudocode now ends towards the end of the sprint. Itving comments in your code that are like a recipe is super viable.
            <br />

            Talking to peers in my cohort was encouraging, and I heard we are all going through similar struggles. Being a remote, part-time course, it is hard to know.
            <br />
            <br />
            I am familiar with but only partially confident in my problem-solving and technical process. I want to improve this.

            <br />
            I reached out to the foundations helpdesk for assistance. Initially, I was hesitant to ask for help because I wanted to ensure that I had exhausted all possible troubleshooting and problem-solving methods on my own. However, I have come to realize that there is no such thing as a dumb question, and I should be more confident in seeking help when needed.
