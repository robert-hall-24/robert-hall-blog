    <h3>
      Explain a situation where you have made an ethical decision. Discuss how
      you weighed up the values involved in that decision, the decision you
      made, and how you reflect on the decision now.
    </h3>
    <p>
      My long career path is to create software that helps people! I have had a
      lot of fun creating the html and css websites. I wanna build on that!
    </p>
    <h3>
      Describe how your culture and the people around you have influenced your
      values and identity.
    </h3>
    <p>
      My strength is the passion to learn new things! Think visually and outside
      the box. I love deep driving into things. My limitation is reading and
      writing.
    </p>
    <h3>
      Evaluate your limitations in terms of your learning and career
      development. How might these affect your learning journey?
    </h3>
    <p>
      My commitment to my workload is around 15 - 20 hours a week for
      foundations. I will ensure I take breaks between long coding sessions and
      treat everyone respectfully. Also, make time to do things that keep me
      happy, like walking the dog, gaming, and hanging with friends.
    </p>
    <h3>
      Share an example of when you were trying to work productively with others,
      but there was resistance or tension. Discuss strategies you tried at the
      time, how effective they were, and your reflections on what other
      strategies you would try now and why.
    </h3>
    <p>
      If I get stuck, I will contact the helpdesk or contact a teacher directly
      on Discord if I am stuck for longer than 15 minutes.
