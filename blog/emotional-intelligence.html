          <h3>EQ</h3>
          <br />
          <p>
            EQ stand for Emotional Quotient or Emotional Intelligence. This is
            in my opinion is one of the most important things to learn. A high
            level definition of EQ is the . It's the ability to understand, use,
            and manage your emotions to communicate effectively, empathize with
            others, and overcome challenges. This helps with relationships,
            decision making and identifying opportunities. One of the tools I
            use to help build my EQ is Mindfulness. The great thing with
            Mindfulness is it pretty easy to start and there are ton of free
            apps you can use to practice this. I use an app called: Mindfulness
            on my apple watch this set to remind around lunch each day to push
            to do this.

          <h3>IQ</h3>
          <br />
          <p>
            IQ stands for Intelligence Quotient. It is scored that measured on
            how good are you at solving problems and logically thinking. This
            one way to measure Intelligence and I just want point out that as
            being dyslexic I didn't really fit the binary of these tests
            sometimes. So it is okay to use this one measure to test your
            Intelligence. But here is the big peak of High IQ. Studies show that
            people with high IQ excel in problem solving. Problem solving is
            huge part of being developer so this defiantly an Advantage.

          <h3>Listen and Loop</h3>
          <br />
          <p>
            This is really good exercise to learn how listen and how it is to be
            heard. This is a good skill to learn as in any conversation you have
            in life listening and trying to understand the information being
            received is a great way to <br />
            build deeper connections in conversations. Also it helps you digest
            what you are hearing and correcting if you maybe mis reading the
            comments being said. Specially when you are being given verbal
            instructions it is important that you understand what is being said.
            Overall practicing listening and looping back is super important.

            Conclusion I would say that EQ, IQ and Listen/Loop are skills and
            measures we should be practicing to striving towards. This helps us
            navigate tough decisions in life. Build better relationships and
            connections. Problem solve more effectively and be curious in
            discussions. The great thing is there is no right way or correct way
            to approach this. It is simply just starting.
