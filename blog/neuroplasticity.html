            Neuroplasticity is challenging our brain to improve a skill or
            subject by practising this repeatly until we improve.
            <br />
            <br />
            The benefits of this show that brain connections are strengthened
            when we practice this more or more. To improve a skill.
            <br />
            <br />
            How does this work? Take learning JavaScript as a neuroplasticity
            example. We exercise our brains every sprint and learn new things.
            Also, our we being given is more challenging. So we are increasing
            our brain's knowledge on this subject more and more.
            <br />
            <br />
            We can leverage neuroplasticity to optimize our learning and improve
            cognitive function.

            A growth mindset changes your perspective and how you approach
            learning and results. This was fascinating to learn about.
            <br />
            <br />
            The TED talk is about our growth mindset sprint knowledge. They
            talked about how they had studied how students reacted when they
            received a complex piece of work above their grade level.
            <br />
            <br />
            The reactions were either. "This is going to be a great challenge.
            Let's do it." Or "Oh no! I don't know how I am going to cope with
            this problem.
            <br />
            <br />
            The one thing that stood out to me was that this is something
            related to this course. We are learning some pretty complex stuff
            fast!
            <br />
            <br />
            The big takeaway is how we use the growth mindset to help us be
            better students. We need to think of failing as not failing and as
            more of a NOT YET. We reward ourselves more for how good our method
            was and how we think about solving the problem than the result
            itself.

            Reflecting on learning about neuroplasticity and growth mindset,
            both are beneficial ways of thinking and learning that can evaluate
            your learning style. Learning code can be complex but also super
            rewarding. We need to remember it is not just about the result. It
            is about the methods and progress we use to make this result happen.
