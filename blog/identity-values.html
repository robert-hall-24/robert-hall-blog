      When I worked in tech retail we had a lot of elderly customer that would
      need help with technolgy. But since they on the NZ super and could not
      afford learning sesions. My manager could not offer discount rates to help
      this gentlement so I ended up paying for half lessons. For four weeks. It
      felt really good to give back to our older generation and teach about they
      techt they own. I do really love helping people so this was fulifing.

    <h3>
      Describe how your culture and the people around you have influenced your
      values and identity.

    <p>
      I am Half Maori and Half NZ European. Also I am gay and dyslexic! Alot of
      things! My values have always been about fighting to fair rights for all.
      Aspecially in tech being minorty can be isolating. So encouraging more
      people like myself into tech defiently influences who I am.

    <h3>
      Evaluate your limitations in terms of your learning and career
      development. How might these affect your learning journey?
    </h3>
    <p>
      My limitations are the way I learn. I am dyslexic so reading and writing
      can be really hard. Aspecially when it is something new! This affects my
      speed. So I am little slower at learning than expected.

      Share an example of when you were trying to work productively with others,
      but there was resistance or tension. Discuss strategies you tried at the
      time, how effective they were, and your reflections on what other
      strategies you would try now and why.

      When I was in uni we had a group project and where trying to decide what
      we should do. We had alot of ideas but could not seem to agree on one. We
      only had two weeks to make something so the time we had together was
      really important. We decided to weigh up the effort and the majority of
      the group that would like to do. We had a few people in the group. That
      didn't like the idea and it took a well for them to come around. As they
      were the ones that said no. We ended having a team meeting and venting our
      feelings. The main concern for this people is they did want to be left
      out.
